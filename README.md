# MachineLearning
Machine Learning Project that I did on the prediction of GPU performance in Scikit Learn

The Main file that contains all of the code that I did will be "MainNotebook.ipynb"

The streamlit application is "FP32Pred_app.py"

I Have also included the Slides I intended to use for the presentation earlier on and a detailed report that I wrote up.

The original dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelbryantds/cpu-and-gpu-product-data
